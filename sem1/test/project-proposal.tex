\section*{Short description}
\label{sec:org4ecb37b}

The task is to adapt \emph{dynamic partial order reduction}
\cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/AbdullaAJS17} to Real-Time ABS
\cite{DBLP:journals/jlp/JohnsenST15}.

\section*{Background and motivation}
\label{sec:org2c578d4}

Real-Time ABS is an executable modeling language, which is suitable for
modeling distributed systems at a high level of abstraction. The language is
object-oriented and features concurrent object groups that communicate via
asynchronous method calls and futures. Models in Real-Time ABS are
nondeterministic, meaning that executing the same model twice might not yield
the same answer. It follows that tests in such a model can sometimes pass and
sometimes fail, making testing such models reliably a very challenging task.

To strengthen testing facilities for Real-Time ABS, we want to be able to
explore many different runs of a model. The number of different possible runs
of a heavily concurrent model can be extremely large. However, many of these
runs may be equivalent and therefore unnecessary to explore. Detecting
equivalent runs is a crucial prerequisite for any exploration-based testing
framework for Real-Time ABS.

The most promising technique for establishing equivalence between different
runs is \emph{partial order reduction} (POR) \cite{DBLP:journals/sttt/ClarkeGMP99}.
In recent years, \emph{dynamic} POR \cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/AbdullaAJS17} has been
shown to guarantee \emph{optimal} partial order reduction. Furthermore, similar
techniques have been adapted to actor systems \cite{DBLP:conf/forte/AlbertAG14}
similar to Real-Time ABS.

\section*{Problem description}
\label{sec:orgbf54a93}

The thesis will consist of both conceptual and implementation work. On the
conceptual side, the dynamic POR algorithm must be adapted to the semantics
of Real-Time ABS. In addition, the algorithm should be optimized for a
distributed environment, as the Real-Time ABS simulator is implemented as a
distributed system in Erlang. Finally, a prototype of the proposed algorithm
will be implemented as a part of the Real-Time ABS simulator.
