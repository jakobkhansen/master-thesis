* Abstract
  - Actor- and active object programs plcae an emphasis on concurrency
  - Paper will show how common rfactorings interact with a cconcurrency model with local
    and remote objects.

* Intro
  - Introduces same deadlock in Hide Delegate as OJ paper

* Syntax & Semantics
  @code abs
  ob(o,a,p,q) 
  /*
  Object with identifier o,
  fields a,
  active process p,
  suspended process pool q
  */
  {l|s} // Substitution l of local variable bindings and list of statements s
  @end


$ Equivalence of configurations
Two configurations are equivalent iff:
  ~ All objects in both configurations have the same values for fields
  ~ All local variables and activation state coincide

$ Notion of refactoring correctness
Given two equivalent configurations and a refactoring Rf, Rf is corrrect iff:
  ~ Given a transition from the original cn to a new cn', there exists an equivalent
  transition from the refactored cn_r to a new cn_r' where $cn = cn_r âˆ§ cn' = cn_r'$
