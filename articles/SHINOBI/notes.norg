* SHINOBI tool
  - VS-Studio tool
  - Detects clones in real-time
  - Uses "Suffix Array Index"
  --- Allows search of similar sequences in O(m log(n)) time
  --- m is sequence length, n is number of all stored tokens
  - Client sends code to server if movement happens
  - Can detect clones withing 0.5 seconds in 4.5MLOC
  - No invocation needed
  - Clone types? Depends on what suffix array index can do?
