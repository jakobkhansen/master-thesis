\chapter{Background}


\subsection{Software quality and duplicated code}

Software quality is hard to define. The term ``quality'' is ambiguous and is in the case
of software quality, multidimensional. Quality in itself has been defined as ``conformance
to requirements''~\cite[8]{crosby1980quality}. In software, A simple measure of
``conformance to requirements'' is correctness, and a lack of bugs. However, software
quality is often measured in other metrics, including metrics which are not directly
related to functionality~\cite[29]{MetricsAndModelsInSoftwareQuality}. These metrics
often include maintainability, analyzability and changeability.

These metrics are affected negatively by duplicated code, code which is more or less
copied to different locations in the source code. Multiple studies have shown that
software projects typically contains $10-15\%$ duplicated code~\cite{CloningByAccident}.
Therefore, research into tools and techniques which can assist in reducing duplicated code
will be of benefit to almost all software.

Duplicated code can lead to a plethora of antipatterns, and will often lead to an increase
in technical debt. Technical debt occurs when developers make technical compromises that
are expedient in the short term, but increases complexity in the
long-term~\cite[111]{TechnicalDebt}. An example of this in the context of duplicated code
is the ``Shotgun-Surgery''~\cite[66]{fowlerrefactoring} antipattern. This antipattern
occurs when a developer wants to implement a change, but needs to change code at multiple
locations for the change to take effect. This is a typical situation which slows down
development and reduces maintainability when the amount of duplicated code increases in a
software project.

\subsection{Code clones}

Duplicated code is often described as ``code clones'', as a pair of code snippets which
are duplicated are considered clones of each other.

\begin{definition}[Code snippet]
	A code snippet is a piece of contiguous source code in a larger software system.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Code clone]
	A code clone is a code snippet which is equal to or similar to another code snippet. The two
	code snippets are both code clones, and together they form a code clone pair.
	Similarity is determined by some metric such as number of equal lines of code.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Clone set]
	A clone set is a set of code snippets where all snippets are considered clones of each
	other.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Clone relation}

The clone relation is a relation between code snippets which defines pairs of clones.
The clone relation is reflexive and symmetric, but not always transitive. The transitive
property depends on the threshold for similarity when identifying code clones. Given

$$a \xleftrightarrow{clone} b \xleftrightarrow{clone} c$$


where $a,b,c$ are code snippets and $\xleftrightarrow{clone}$ gives the clone relation, $a$ is
a clone of $b$, but not necessarily similar enough to be a clone of $c$, depending on the
threshold for similarity.

If the threshold for similarity is defined such that only equal clones are considered
clones, the relation becomes transitive, and equivalence classes form clone sets.

\subsubsection{Code clone types}

Code clones are generally classified into four types~\cite{Inoue_introduction_to_cc}. The
types classify code snippets as code clones with an increasing amount of leniency.
Therefore, Type-1 code clones are very similar, while Type-4 clones are not necessarily
similar at all. When defining types, it is the syntactic and structural differences which
is compared, not functionality. The set of code clones classified by a code clone type
is also a subset of the next type, meaning all Type-1 clones are also Type-2 clones, but
not vice versa.

The code clone types are defined as follows:

\textbf{Type-1} clones are syntactically identical. The only differences allowed are elements
without meaning, like comments and white-space. Example:

% TODO this looks like shit
\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c | c}
            \begin{lstlisting}
for (int i = 0; i < 10;   i++) {

    print(i);
}
        \end{lstlisting} &
			\begin{lstlisting}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // A comment

    print(i);
}
        \end{lstlisting}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{tcolorbox}


\textbf{Type-2} clones are structurally identical. Possible differences include
identifiers, literals and types. Type-2 clones are relatively easy to detect by
consistently renaming identifiers and literals~\cite[2]{Zibran_real_time_search}. This
type of clone is relevant to consider in merging scenarios because this type of clone can
be relatively simple to parameterize in order to merge two Type-2 clones. Example:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tcolorbox}
		\begin{tabular}{c | c}
			\begin{lstlisting}
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i);
}
    \end{lstlisting} &
	\begin{lstlisting}
for (int (*\textbf j*) = (*\textbf 1*); (*\textbf j*) < 10; (*\textbf j++*)) {
    print((*\textbf j*));
}
    \end{lstlisting}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

\textbf{Type-3} clones are required to be structurally similar, but not equal. Differences
include statements which are added, removed or modified. This clone type relies on a
threshold $\theta$ which determines how structurally different snippets can be to be
considered Type-3 clones~\cite{Inoue_introduction_to_cc}. The granularity for this
difference could be based on differing tokens, lines, etc. Detecting this type of clone is
hard. Example:

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c | c}
			\begin{lstlisting}
// Clone 1
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i);
}
\end{lstlisting} &
			\begin{lstlisting}
// Clone 2
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i);
    (*\textbf{int x = 10;}*)
}
\end{lstlisting}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{tcolorbox}




In this example there is a one line difference between the two snippets, so if $\theta
	\geq
	1$, the two snippets would be considered Type-3 clones.

\textbf{Type-4} clones have no requirement for syntactical or structural similarity, but
are generally only relevant to detect when they have similar functionality. Detecting this
type of clone is very challenging, but attempts have been made using program dependency
graphs~\cite{SeedType4Detection}. The following example shows two code snippets which have
no clear syntactic or structural similarity, but is functionally equal:

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c | c}
			\begin{lstlisting}
print((n*(n-1))/2)

print(sum);
\end{lstlisting} &
			\begin{lstlisting}
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
        sum++;
    }
}
print(sum);
\end{lstlisting}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{tcolorbox}


Type-1 clones are often referred to as ``exact'' clones, while Type-2 and Type-3 clones
are referred to as ``near-miss'' clones~\cite[1]{Zibran_real_time_search}.

\subsubsection{Code clone detection process and techniques}

\textbf{The Code clone detection process} is generally split into (but is not limited to)
a set of steps to identify clones~\cite{Inoue_introduction_to_cc}. This
process is often a pipeline of input-processing steps before finally comparing fragments
against each other and filtering. The steps are generally as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Pre-processing}: Filter uninteresting code that we do not want to
	      check for clones, for example generated code. Then partition code into a set of
	      fragments, depending on granularity such as methods, files or lines.
	\item \textbf{Transformation}: Transform fragments into an intermediate
	      representation, with a source-map back to the original code.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Extraction: Transform source code into the input for the comparison
		            algorithm. Can be tokens, AST, dependency graphs, suffix tree, etc.
		      \item Normalization: Optional step which removes superficial differences such as
		            comments, whitespace and identifier names. Often useful for identifying type-2
		            clones.
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Match detection}: Perform comparisons which outputs a set of
	      candidate clone pairs.
	\item \textbf{Source-mapping / Formatting}: Convert candidate clone pairs from the transformed
	      code back to clone pairs in the original source code.
	\item \textbf{Post-processing / Filtering}: Ranking and filtering manually or with
	      automated heuristics
	\item \textbf{Aggregation}: Optionally aggregating sets of clone pairs into clone sets
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Matching techniques} are techniques which can be applied to source-code to
detect clone-pairs. Most matching technique will also require specific pre-processing to be
done in the earlier steps, for example building an AST. Some of the most explored
techniques are as follows~\cite{ComparisonAndEvaluationOfTechniques}:

\paragraph{Text-based} approaches do very little processing on the source code before
comparing. Simple techniques such as fingerprinting or incremental hashing have been used
in this approach. Dot plots have also been used in newer text-based approaches, placing
the hashes of fragments in a dot plot for use in comparisons.

\paragraph{Token-based} approaches transform source code into a stream of tokens, similar
to lexical scanning in compilers. The token stream is then scanned for duplicated
subsequences of tokens. Since token streams can easily filter out superficial differences
such as whitespace, indentation and comments, this approach is more robust to such
differences. Concrete names of identifiers and values can be abstracted away when
comparing the token-stream, therefore Type-2 clones can easily be identified. Type-3
clones can also be identified by comparing the fragments tokens and keeping clone pairs
with a lexical difference lower than a given threshold. This can be solved with dynamic
programming~\cite{BakerSparseDynamicProgramming}. A common approach to detect clones using
token-streams is with a suffix-tree. A suffix-tree can solve the \textit{Find all maximal
repeats} problem efficiently, which in essence is the same problem as finding clone pairs.
This algorithm can also be improved to use a suffix-array instead, which requires less
memory. This type of code clone detection is regarded as very fast compared to more
intricate types of matching techniques.

\paragraph{Syntactic} approaches transform source code into either concrete syntax trees
or abstract syntax trees and find clones using either tree matching algorithms or
structural metrics. For tree matching, the common approach is to find similar subtrees,
which are then deemed as clone pairs. One way of finding similar subtrees is to hash
subtrees into buckets and compare them with a tolerant tree matching algorithm. Variable
names, literal values and other source may be abstracted to find Type-2 clones more
easily. Metrics-based techniques gather metrics for code fragments in the tree and uses
the metrics to determine if the fragments are clones or not. One way is to use
fingerprint functions where the fingerprint includes certain metrics, and compare the
fingerprints of all fragments to find clones.

\paragraph{Chunk-based} approaches decompose chunks of source code into signatures which are
compared. Chunk-size is based on selected granularity, which can be functions, blocks,
etc. Signatures can for example be based on some software metrics. Machine learning has
been used in this approach using methods as chunks and token-frequency within the method
as signature. A Deep Neural Network trained on this data can then be used to classify two
chunks as clone or non-clone~\cite{CCLearner}.

\paragraph{Hybrid} approaches combine multiple approaches in order to improve detection.
For example Zibran et al. developed a hybrid algorithm combining both token-based suffix
trees for Type-1 and Type-2 clone detection, with a k-difference dynamic programming
algorithm for Type-3 clone detection~\cite{Zibran_real_time_search}.

\subsection{Incremental editing and analysis}

While writing code, programmers usually only edit small portions of text at a time. One
``edit'' will therefore only affect small parts of the internal representations of the
code which most tools use to perform analysis. Reusing parts of this representation would
therefore be faster and allow programming tools to scale better.

\subsubsection{Incremental parsing}

Incremental parsing is the process of reparsing only parts of a syntax tree whenever an
edit is performed. The motivation behind incremental parsing is to have a readily
available syntax tree after every edit, while doing as little computing as possible to
build it.

Ghezzi and Mandrioli introduced in 1979 the notion of incremental parsing, and
introduced an incremental parser for LR $\land$ RL grammars. However, they were aware that
this algorithm was both slow and did not allow expressive enough
grammars.~\cite{IncrementalParsing}

Tim A. Wagner et al.~\cite{PracticalAlgorithmsForIncremental} later published a large work
on incremental software development environments, presenting many novel algorithms and
techniques for incremental tooling in programming environments.

``Tree-sitter'' is a parser generator tool which specializes in incremental parsing.
Inspired by Wagner's work, it supports incremental parsing, error recovery and querying
for specific nodes and subtrees~\cite{treesitter}. These features combined allow
Tree-sitter to become a powerful tool for analysis and has been used for editor features
such as syntax-highlighting, refactoring and code navigation.

\subsubsection{Incremental clone detection}

Incremental clone detection involves avoiding recalculation of already calculated results
when doing code clone detection. Since most code of a codebase will not change between
revisions, a lot of processing can be avoided. However, this is not a simple problem,
since changes in a single location can affect clone detection results across the entire
codebase.

In order to incrementally detect code clones, an algorithm which first calculates the
initial code clones is run, and for successive revisions of the source code, this list is
incrementally updated, more efficiently than the initial run. Different approaches have
been used to accomplish this.

Göde and Koschke~\cite{GodeIncrementalCloneDetection} proposed the first incremental clone
detection algorithm. The algorithm employs a generalized suffix tree in which the amount
of work of updating is only dependent on the size of the edited code. This approach is
limited in scalability, as generalized suffix trees require a substantial amount of
memory.

Nguyen et al.~\cite{LocalitySensitiveHashingIncremental} showed that an AST-based approach
utilizing ``Locality-Sensitive Hashing'' can detect clones incrementally with high
precision, and showed that incremental updates could be done in real-time ($< 1$ second)
for source code with a size of 300 KLOC.

Hummel et al.~\cite{IndexBasedIncrementalCloneDetection} later introduced the first incremental,
scalable and distributed clone detection technique for Type-1 and Type-2 clones. This
approach utilizes a custom ``clone index'' data structure which can be updated
efficiently. The implementation of this data structure is similar to that of an inverted
index. This technique uses distributed computing to speed up its detection process.

More recently, Ragkhitwetsagul and Krinke~\cite{SiameseScalableAndIncrementalClone}
presented the tool ``Siamese'', which uses a novel approach of having multiple
intermediate representations of source code to detect a high number of clones with
support for incremental detection. The tool can detect up to Type-3 clones, but will only
give clones based on ``queries'' given to it by the user. Queries are either files or
methods in source-code, which are then checked for existing code clone.

\subsection{IDE tooling and LSP}

\subsubsection{Existing IDE tools for clone management}

Developers are not always aware of the creation of clones in their code. Clone aware
development means having clone management as a part of the software development process.
Since code clones can be hard to keep track of and manage, tools which help developers
deal with clones are useful. However, Mathias Rieger et al. claims that a problem with
many detection tools is that the tools ``report large amounts data that must be treated
with little tool support''~\cite[1]{InsightsSystemWideDuplication}. Detecting and
eliminating clones early in their lifecycle with IDE integrated tools could be a solution
to the problem of dealing with too many clones.

There are many existing clone management tools, and the following section will go over
tools which are integrated into an IDE and offer services to the programmer while
developing in real-time.

The IDE-based tools which exist can be categorized as
follows~\cite[8]{Udding_Towards_Convenient_Management}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textit{Copy-paste-clones:} This category of tools deals only with code snippets which are
	copy-pasted from another location in code. These tools therefore only track clones which
	are created when copy-pasting, and does not use any other detection techniques. Therefore,
	this type of tool is not suitable for detecting clones which are made accidentally, since
	developers are aware that they are creating clones when pasting already existing code
	snippets.

	\item\textit{Clone detection and visualization tools:} This category of tools has more
	sophisticated clone detection capabilities and will detect code clones which occur
	accidentally.

	\item\textit{Versatile clone management:} This category of tools covers tools which provide more
	services than the above. Services like refactoring and simultaneous editing of clones fall
	under this category.
\end{itemize}

There are a few existing IDE-tools which have seen success in real-time detection of clones:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Minhaz et al. introduced a hybrid technique for performing real-time focused
	      searches, i.e. searching for code clones of a selected code snippet. This
	      technique can also detect Type-3 clones~\cite{Zibran_real_time_search}. It was
	      later used in the tool
	      \textit{SimEclipse}~\cite{Udding_Towards_Convenient_Management} which is a plugin
	      for the Eclipse editor. Since this tool can only detect clones of a code snippet
	      which the developer actively selects, this tool is not well suited for finding
	      accidental clones and tracking clones in areas.

	\item Another tool, SHINOBI, which is a plugin for the Visual Studio editor, can
	      detect code clones in real-time without the need of the developer to select a code
	      snippet. It can detect Type-1 and Type-2 code clones and uses a token-based suffix
	      array index approach to detect clones incrementally~\cite{SHINOBI}.

	\item The modern IDE IntelliJ has a built-in duplication detection and refactoring
	      service, it is able to detect Type-1 and (some) type-2 code clones at a method
	      granularity and refactors by replacing one of the clones with a method call to the
	      other.

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/lspcommunication.png}
	\caption{Example client-server interaction using LSP}
	\label{fig:lspcommunication}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Language Server Protocol}

Usually, static analysis tools which integrate with IDEs are tightly coupled to a specific
IDE and its APIs, like parsing and refactoring support. This makes the tools hard to
utilize a tool in another IDE, since the API's the tool utilizes is no longer available.
In order to make IDE-based static analysis tools more widely available, it would be
interesting to determine if such tools could be made editor agnostic.

The Language Server protocol (LSP) is a protocol which specifies interaction between a
client (IDE) and server in order to provide language tooling for the client. The goal of
the protocol is to avoid multiple implementations of the same language tools for every IDE
and every language, allowing for editor agnostic tooling. Servers which implement LSP will
be able to offer IDEs code-completion, error-messages, go-to-definition and more. LSP also
specifies generic code-actions and commands, which the LSP server provides to the client
in order to perform custom actions defined by the server.

Figure \ref{fig:lspcommunication} shows a sample interaction between client and server
using LSP. The client sends requests to a server in the form of JSON-RPC messages, and the
server sends a corresponding response, also in the form of JSON-RPC messages.

\section{Preliminary algorithms and data structures}

The following algorithms and data structures will be useful in following chapters to
define the detection algorithm

\subsection{Incremental-parsing}

In our detection algorithm we will need to be able to parse our source-code in order to select
specific syntactic regions and extract the tokens.

\subsection{Suffix trees}

% TODO cite suffix tree algorithms here
A classic algorithm for code clone detection traverses a suffix-tree in order to find
maximal repeats in all suffixes of the input string T.

The suffix tree of a string $T$ is a compressed trie where all the suffixes of $T$ have been
inserted. The tree is compressed by combining consecutive nodes in a row which has
only one child into a single node. 

Suffix trees can be constructed in linear time with Ukkonen's algorithm which builds a
larger and larger suffix tree by inserting characters one by one and utilizing some tricks
to avoid inserting suffixes before it needs to, to lower the complexity. \cite{Ukkonen}

This data structure facilitates solving the maximal repeat problem. A repeat in a string T
is a substring that occurs at least twice in T. A maximal repeat in T is a repeat which is not
a substring of another repeat in T, meaning that the maximal repeat cannot be extended in
any direction to form a bigger repeat. This problem can be solved with a suffix tree using
the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Repeats in suffix tree]
    Every internal node in a suffix tree corresponds to a substring which is repeated at least
    twice in T. The substring is found by concatenating the strings found on the path from
    the root of tree to the internal node.
\end{theorem}

This theorem is explained by the fact that any internal node has at least two children, and a
node having two children means that two suffixes share the same prefix up to that point.
An algorithm which finds the longest maximal repeat would find the internal node with
represents the longest string. 

The classic algorithm\cite{Zibran_real_time_search, GodeIncrementalCloneDetection} in
terms of finding duplication in a string (such as source code) using suffix trees would
find all repeats of length $k$ where $k$ is the threshold for how long a clone needs to
be. This can be found by traversing the suffix tree and looking at all internal nodes
which represent a string of length $\geq k$. Every internal node which represents a string
which is $\geq k$ would correspond to a substring of the source code which occurs at least
twice. Finding where the duplication occurs can be done by finding all the leaves of the
subtree rooted in the internal node, which each hold the position where the suffix starts in
T. Since a substring can have multiple repeats of different lengths longer than $k$,
different strategies can be used to select which substrings are selected or not, such as
filtering out repeats which are not maximal or repeats which contain or overlap each other.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Suffix arrays}

The suffix array (SA) of a string T contains a lexicographical sorting of all suffixes in
T. The suffix array does not contain the actual suffixes, but it contains integers
pointing to the index where the suffix starts in T. 
Conversely, the inverse suffix array (\texttt{ISA}) contains integers describing which
rank a suffix has. \texttt{ISA} is therefore the inverse array of
\texttt{SA}, such that if \texttt{SA[i] = n}, then \texttt{ISA[n] = i}.

\begin{definition}[Suffix array] 
    Let T be a text of length N.
    The suffix array \texttt{SA} of T is an array of length N where \texttt{SA[i] = n} if the
    suffix at \texttt{T[n..N-1]} is the ith smallest suffix in T lexicographically.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Inverse suffix array] 
    Let T be a text of length N.
    The inverse suffix array ISA of T is an array of length N where \texttt{ISA[i] = n} if the
    suffix at \texttt{T[i..N-1]} is the nth smallest suffix in T lexicographically.
\end{definition}

The Longest-common prefix (LCP) array of a string T of length N is an array of length N
such that each element contains the length of the common prefix between two suffixes in T.
The suffixes are ordered in the same order as the suffix array. Since the suffix array
represents suffixes in a sorted order, the prefix length between adjacent suffixes in SA
will be the longest possible common prefix for each suffix. These values are the values in
the LCP array.

\begin{definition}[LCP array]
    Let T be a text of length N and SA be the suffix array of T.
    The LCP array of T is an array of length N where \texttt{LCP[i] = n} if the suffix
    \texttt{T[SA[i]..N]} and \texttt{T[SA[i-1]..N]} has a common prefix of length
    \texttt{n}. \texttt{LCP[0]} is undefined or {0}.
\end{definition}

between the sorted suffixes and SA, ISA and LCP.

% TODO add correlation between suffix array and tree here with applications

Suffix arrays can be constructed in linear time in terms of the length of T. Many suffix
array construction algorithms (SACA) have been discovered in the last
decade\cite{SuffixArrayConstruction}, many of which run in linear-time. An algorithm which
has been shown to be very efficient in practice is Nong and
Chan's\cite{LinearTimeSuffixArraySAIS} algorithm based on induction sorting. Since ISA is
the inverse of the suffix array, it can also be constructed in linear time by first
constructing the suffix array.

The LCP array can also be constructed in linear time, utilizing SA and ISA.



\subsection{Dynamic bitsets}

A bitset is an array of bits, each bit representing either the value true or false. A bit
with the value of 1 is usually referred to as a set bit, and a value of 0 is referred to
as an unset or cleared bit. Bitsets have at least operations for setting the value at a
position, and looking up the value at a position. Bitsets are useful for many problems,
especially as a ``succinct data structure''. A succinct data structure is a data structure
which attempts to use an amount of memory close to the theoretic lower bound, while still
allowing effective queries on it. For example for a string of length $N$, we could store
up to $O(n \log_{}\sigma)$ bits before the bit vector exceeds the size of the string
itself, where $\sigma$ is the size of the string's alphabet.

The most well known query to do on bitsets is the rank/select queries.

\begin{definition}[Rank query]
    A rank query $rank_1(i)$ on a bitset B, returns the number of set bits
    up to, but not including position $i$. Conversely, $rank_0(B)$ returns the number of
    unset bits up to $i$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Select query]
    A select query $select_1(i)$ on a bitset B, returns the position of the ith
    set bit in B. Conversely, $select_0(i)$ returns the position of the ith unset bit in
    B.
\end{definition}

% TODO citation needed
Jacobson's rank can calculate rank and select on static bitsets in $O(1)$ time by
pre-calculating all answers in a space efficient table.

\begin{definition}[Dynamic bitset]
    A dynamic bitset is a bitset which in addition to other operations allow inserting and
    deleting bits (indel operations).

    An insert operation $insert(i, v)$ on a bitset B inserts the value v at position i in
    B, pushing all values at position $\geq i$ one position up.

    A delete operation $delete(i)$ on a bitset B removes the value at position i in B, pushing all
    values at position $> i$ one position down.
\end{definition}

The standard implementation of a dynamic bitset would implement the whole bitset as a
single array of bytes $B$, which allows for accessing values in $O(1)$ time, but inserting
and deleting takes $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of bits in $B$.

One way to speed up the indel operations would be to represent the bitset as a balanced
tree containing multiple smaller bitsets. To represent a bitset of $N$ bits, we can divide
the bits into smaller bitsets, such that $O(\frac{n}{\log(n)})$ bitsets each contains
$O(log(n))$ bits. Since the bitsets are now of size $O(log(n))$, inserting and
deleting takes only $O(log(n))$ time. The bitsets reside at the leaves of our balanced
tree, and internal nodes contain only two integers, storing the number of bits in the left
subtree ($N$), and the number of set bits in the left subtree ($S$). To access, insert or
delete on index $i$, the tree is traversed to find the correct bitset where the ith bit is
located, where the operation is done at that position. Finding the correct bitset and
position is done by utilizing $N$ and $S$ in each node which is traversed. All operations
now run in $O(\log(n))$ time, since traversing the tree to the correct bitset takes
$O(\log(\frac{n}{\log(n)}))$ and performing the operation takes $O(\log(n))$ time.


% TODO should I add pseudocode for all operations?
Figure \ref{fig:DynamicBitset} shows how a dynamic bitset tree is structured, and Algorithm
\ref{alg:dynbitaccess} shows how to access a value in the tree. Traversing the
tree to calculate rank and select queries can be done similarly by summing set
bits in left-subtrees (rank) or selecting which subtree to descend based on the number of
set bits (select).

\subsection{Burrows-Wheeler transform}

% TODO add source

The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is a transform on strings, often done to improve
compression. The transform is computed by sorting all ``cyclic-shifts'' of the string
lexicographically and extracting a new string from the last column of the cyclic-shift''
matrix. The terminating character \$ is always the smallest character lexicographically.
Table \ref{table:bwt} shows the BWT for the string T = BANANA\$.

There is a direct correlation between the suffix array of T and the BWT of T. Figure
\ref{table:bwt} also shows that the indices of the sorted cyclic-shifts correspond to
exactly the SA of T. This coincides because when sorting cyclic-shifts, everything that
occurs after the \$ of the cyclic-shift will not affect its lexicographical ordering. This
is because no cyclic-shift will have a \$ in the same position, so comparing two cyclic
shifts lexicographically will always terminate whenever a \$ is found. This means that the
ordering of cyclic shifts is essentially the same as sorting all suffixes of T. Algorithm
\ref{alg:bwt} shows how the BWT of T can be calculated directly from the SA of T in linear
time. Since this is a 1:1 correlation between the SA and BWT, dynamic updates to a BWT
would correspond to similar dynamic updates in the SA (and ISA). This will be useful in
the following implementation chapter for the dynamic code clone detection algorithm.

\begin{algorithm}[htp]
  \SetAlgoLined\DontPrintSemicolon
    \algo{\bwt{T, SA}}{
        $N \gets len(T)$

        $BWT \gets \text{string of length } N$

        \For{$i \in 0..N$}{

            pos $\gets$ (SA[i] - 1) \% N

            $BWT[i] = T[pos]$
        }

        \Return BWT
    }

  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \caption{Calculating the BWT of a string T from its suffix array}
  \label{alg:bwt}
\end{algorithm}


An essential property of the BWT is that the transformation is reversible. By examining
the BWT of a string T, we see that the BWT is a permutation of T. We will also see that
there is a correlation between the characters in the first column of the cyclic-shift
matrix and the last column (the BWT).

T can be calculated from the BWT as long as there is a unique terminating character (\$),
or the position of the final character is stored. T is computed backwards by starting at
the final character ($T[n - 1]$) and then finding the cyclic-shift where that character
occurs in the first column (the previous cyclic-shift). The character in the last column
of that cyclic-shift is $T[n - 2]$. If there are multiple of the same character, the nth
occurrence of a certain symbol in the last column will map to the nth occurrence of the
same symbol in the first column. This process is repeated until we finish the cycle,
returning to the final character in the last column. Essentially, this process consists of
traversing cyclic-shifts backwards and looking at the final character, which will give us
T, since the final character of the cyclic-shift is continually shifting one position.

We can use the fact that the first column consists of the letters of T in sorted order to
determine the previous cyclic-shift with only the last column. We can calculate the
previous cyclic-shift from only the last column by determining how many characters are
lexicographically smaller than the current character, and also the rank of the current
character at this position. The sum of these two values is the location of the previous
cyclic-shift. This function is called the Last-to-first mapping (LF-mapping). Calculating
the LF-mapping can be done efficiently by using a rank/select data structure to calculate
the rank of all the characters in the BWT, and an array which contains the number of
occurrences of each letter in the BWT.

The LF-mapping will also be useful in the detection algorithm when dynamically updating
the suffix array.

\subsection{Dynamic suffix arrays}

\section{Our contribution}

This thesis will present and evaluate a tool which provides clone detection capabilities
in a real-time IDE environment. The main goal will be to create an incremental tool which
fits well into the development cycle and can efficiently update its results while writing
code. 
    
Existing incremental clone detection tools either do not fit into an IDE scenario
(techniques based on distributed computing) or have not been shown to scale well in terms
of processing time or memory usage for larger codebases of multiple million lines of code.
Areas of focus will therefore be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time / Incremental detection of code clones for IDE's 
    \item A novel application and extension of dynamic suffix arrays for code clone detection
	\item IDE and language agnostic tooling such as LSP and Tree-sitter
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Incremental clone detection using dynamic suffix arrays}

The main area which we have focused on is making the tool efficient in terms of
incrementally updating whenever edits are performed in the IDE. Most clone detection
tools calculates clones from scratch and have no functionality to more efficiently
calculate the clones after a small edit has been applied to the source code. Our tool
utilizes dynamic suffix arrays to quickly update and find/remove clones, often faster than
calculating the clones from scratch using a linear time suffix array construction
algorithm.

We have also focused on how necessary information to calculate the clones are stored in
memory in order to avoid too much memory usage, without loss in terms of accuracy of
clones, or time spent calculating them.

\subsection{LSP for IDE-based clone detection}

The tool gives programmers the ability to view clones in their IDE. Utilizing features of
LSP such as diagnostics and code-actions, the tool provides clone management to any
editor which implements the LSP protocol.


The interaction with the LSP server will depend on the client's implementation of LSP. If
the LSP client is limited in its capabilities, meaning it does not implement the entire
protocol, the tool will be limited in how the programmer can interact with it.
