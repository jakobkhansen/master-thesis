\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors Volker Stolz and Lars Tveito.
Thank you Volker, for giving me countless advice, feedback and for allowing me to explore
and pursue this topic, even if it was not what we originally thought this thesis would be
about. Thank you Lars, for always being an incredibly positive and motivating supervisor,
and for always being available for a coffee chat. This thesis would not be possible
without them. I would also like to thank my family and my girlfriend, for always being
there to support me during this process. Finally, I would like to thank my co-students and
those who have taken the time to proofread this thesis.
