\chapter*{Abstract} 

Duplicate code is present in most software today. The presence of duplicate code can
negatively affect the maintainability and extensibility of the software, as modifying
duplicated code can often lead to modifying every instance of the duplication. In this
thesis we present CCDetect\nobreakdash-LSP, a duplicate code detection tool which targets
the IDE scenario and is both programming language- and IDE agnostic. Duplicate code
detection can be expensive in terms of time and memory, which means most detection
algorithms cannot be continuously run in a live environment, such as while editing code in
an IDE. In order to facilitate live detection of duplicate code in a code base where small
incremental edits are applied, our tool implements a novel detection algorithm which
supports fast incremental updates. Our empirical results demonstrate that our incremental
algorithm scales better than other non-incremental and incremental algorithms, when small
edits are applied to a code base.
