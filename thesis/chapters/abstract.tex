\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis we present CCDetect-LSP, a duplicate code detection tool which targets the
IDE scenario and implements a novel incremental detection algorithm. The algorithm aims to
have faster incremental updates than running a full duplicate code analysis multiple
times, when code is being edited. The tool is also programming language and IDE agnostic.
Duplicate code is present in almost all software today. The presence of duplicate code can
negatively affect the maintainability and extensibility of the software, as multiple
changes often need to occur when a duplicated section of code needs to be modified.
Algorithms and tools which facilitates detection, management and refactoring of duplicated
code is therefore an important resource for software engineers and researchers. Clone
detection can be expensive in terms of time and memory, and this cost grows with the size
of the code base. Incremental detection algorithms which do not need to run the entire
analysis from scratch for consecutive revisions of the code base, is therefore especially
interesting for use cases such as when running the detection tool in an IDE.
