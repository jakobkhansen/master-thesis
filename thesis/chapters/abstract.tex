\chapter*{Abstract}

Duplicated code, code which is more or less copied to different locations in a code base
is present in almost all software today. This can especially affect the maintainability
and extensibility of the software. Algorithms and tools which facilitates detection and
management of duplicated codes is therefore an important research field. Incremental
detection algorithms, algorithms which do not need to run the entire analysis from scratch
for consecutive revisions of the code base, is especially interesting for use cases such
as when running the detection tool in an IDE. In this thesis we present CCDetect-LSP, a
duplicate code detection tool which targets the IDE scenario and implements a novel
incremental clone detection algorithm, which aims to be faster than rerunning the analysis
from scratch.
