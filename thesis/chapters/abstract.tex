\chapter*{Abstract}

Duplicate code is present in almost all software today. The presence of duplicate code can
negatively affect the maintainability and extensibility of the software, as multiple
changes often need to occur when a duplicated section of code needs to be modified.
Algorithms and tools which facilitates detection, management and refactoring of duplicated
code is therefore an important resource for software engineers and researchers. Clone
detection can be expensive in terms of time and memory, and this cost grows with the size
of the code base. Incremental detection algorithms, algorithms which do not need to run
the entire analysis from scratch for consecutive revisions of the code base, is especially
interesting for use cases such as when running the detection tool in an IDE. In this
thesis we present CCDetect-LSP, a duplicate code detection tool which targets the IDE
scenario and implements a novel incremental detection algorithm, which aims to be faster
than rerunning the analysis entirely, when code is being edited.
