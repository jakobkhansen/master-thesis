\chapter{Implementation: LSP server architecture}
\label{lspimplementation}

CCDetect-LSP is integrated into IDEs via the Language server protocol. The tool starts up as
an LSP server, which an IDE client can connect to and send/receive messages from. The goal
of the LSP client-server interaction is to give users of the tool an overview of all
clones as they appear. The LSP server is implemented in Java with the LSP4J library which
provides an abstraction layer on top of the protocol which is easier to work with
programmatically.

The LSP server shows error-messages (diagnostics) which indicate which section of code a
clone covers, they also provide information about the matching clones and code-actions to
navigate between them. Whenever source code is edited, the LSP server receives a message
containing information about what has changed. The LSP server then generates a new list of
clones, and displays those to the client instead.

The following user-stories shows how interaction with the LSP server works.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A programmer wants to see code clones for a file in their project, the
	      programmer opens the file in their IDE and is displayed diagnostics in the code
	      wherever there are detected clones. The matching code clones are not necessarily
	      in the same file.

	\item A programmer wants to see all code clones for the current project. The
	      programmer opens the IDEs diagnostic view and will see all code clones detected
	      as diagnostics there. The diagnostic will contain information like where the clone
	      exists, and where the matching clone(s) are.

	\item A programmer wants to jump to one of the matches of a code clone in their
	      editor. The programmer moves their cursor to the diagnostic and will see a list of
	      the matching code clones. The programmer will select the wanted code clone which
	      will move the cursor to the file and location of the selected code clone.
          Alternatively, a code-action can be invoked to navigate, if the client does not
          implement the \verb|DiagnosticRelatedInformation| interface.

      \item A programmer wants to remove a set of clones by applying the
          ``extract-method'' refactoring. The programmer performs the necessary
          refactorings, and will see that all the previously detected clones are gone when
          the LSP server updates.

\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} shows the architecture of the tool. The LSP module
communicates with the IDE and delegates the work of handling documents to the document
index. Detection of clones is delegated to the detection module. The LSP module receives a
list of clones from the detection module which is then converted to LSP diagnostics and
code-actions which is finally sent to the client.

\section{Document index}

Upon starting, the LSP server requires indexing of the project for conducting analysis.
This involves creating an index and inserting all the relevant documents in the code base.
A document contains the content of a file along with extra information such as the file's
URI and some information which is useful for the later clone detection. We define the
following record for our documents:

\begin{lstlisting}
    record Document {
        String uri,
        String content,
        AST ast,

        // Location in fingerprint
        int start,
        int end

        // Used for incremental updates
        int[] fingerprint,
        boolean open,
        boolean changed,
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Each document in the index primarily consists of the contents, the URI and the AST of the
document in its current state. Storing the AST will be useful for the incremental
detection algorithm.

There are two things to consider when determining which files should be inserted into the
index. First, we are considering only files of a specific file type, since the tool does
not allow analysis of multiple programming languages at the same time. Therefore, the
index should contain for example only \verb|*.java| files if Java is the language to
analyze. Secondly, all files of that file type might not be relevant to consider in the
analysis. This could for example be generated code, which generally contains a lot of
duplication, but is not practical or necessary to consider as duplicate code, since this
is not code which the programmer interact with directly. Therefore, the default behavior
is to consider only files of the correct file type, which are checked into Git. The tool
supports adding all files in a folder, or all files checked into Git.

When a document is first indexed by the server, the file contents is read from the disk.
However, as soon as the programmer opens this file in their IDE, the source of truth for
the files content is no longer on the disk, as the programmer is changing the file
continuously before writing to the disk. The LSP protocol defines multiple RPC
messages which the client sends to the server in order for the server to keep track of
which files are opened, and the state of the content of opened files.

Upon opening a file, the client will send a \verb|textDocument/didOpen| message to the
server, which contains the URI for the opened file. The index will at this point set the
flag \verb|open| for the relevant document and stops reading its contents from disk.
Instead, updates to the file are obtained via the \verb|textDocument/didChange| message.
This message can provide either the entire content of the file each time the file changes,
or it can provide only the changes and the location of the change. Receiving only the
changes will be useful for this algorithm when the analysis incrementally reparses the
document.

\section{Displaying and interacting with clones}

When detection is finished and the list of clones is ready, the LSP module will convert
clones into diagnostics and code-actions which can be interacted with from the client. For
diagnostics, each clone object is converted into a diagnostic which has a range and some
information about the clone. The diagnostic displays an error in the client which also has
information for each matching clone. This is achieved this by attaching
\verb|DiagnosticRelatedInformation| to a diagnostic which is defined in the protocol. When
all the code clones have been converted to diagnostics, the server sends a
\verb|textDocument/publishDiagnostics| which sends all the diagnostics in JSON-RPC format.
For code-actions, the process is similar, for each clone pair, we create a code-action
which navigates from one to the other, using the \verb|window/showDocument| message. These
code-actions are similarly sent to the client via the \verb|textDocument/codeAction|
message, but this message is only invoked when the client specifically requests code
actions at a certain location.

Figure \ref{fig:vscodeclones} shows how clones are displayed in the VSCode IDE. Code
clones are displayed inline in the file as an ``Information'' diagnostic, and when hovered
over, the client shows the \verb|DiagnosticRelatedInformation| information of the diagnostic
where all the matching clones are displayed and can be clicked to navigate to the
corresponding match. For a client which may not implement the
\verb|DiagnosticRelatedInformation| message (which was added in LSP version 3.16), invoking
the code-action to navigate to the matching clone is another option.
