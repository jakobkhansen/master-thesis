\chapter{Conclusion and future work}

The results show that CCDetect incremental algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms
both in terms of time and memory on larger code bases. Our algorithm was able to handle
large edits in an IDE environment for 5.8MLOC in under 2 second,

\section{Future work}
