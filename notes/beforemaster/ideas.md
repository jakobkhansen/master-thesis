# Ideas

Here I will write down ideas for my master thesis before I actually start my degree.

### Automatic refactoring

I had a meeting with Volker Stolz on writing a master thesis about refactoring. This
seemed very interesting as I would get to learn more about programming languages,
grammars, LSP and maybe concurrency. He suggested that I could implement the refactoring
in LSP of an old master thesis as part of my essay, which would give me experience with
both abs (the IFI inhouse programming language I would use) and LSP. This is very
interesting and I'm almost ready to say that I want this to be my master thesis.


##### Design pattern refactoring idea

Would it be possible to take a class, block of code, method or whatever and say "I
want this to be implemented as design pattern x"? For example, would it be possible to
take a class and say "I want this to follow the factory design pattern, create a factory
for me". It would probably be possible for simpler patterns like singleton, but maybe not
so much for more complex patterns? 

What about architectural patterns, that's probably too ambitious, right?

This would definitely require independent implementation of every design pattern, and
would likely need the programmer to make choices during the refactoring, is that stupid?
Probably.
