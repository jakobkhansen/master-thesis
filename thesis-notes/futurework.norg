- Extend to more clone types
--- Especially seeing how one could detect type-3 clones efficiently in a dynamically
    updating suffix array would be interesting.

- Reconsidering how the suffix array is stored
--- Salon et al proposes a way to compress the suffix array, could one do this for the LCP
    array as well?

- Using tree-matching algorithms instead of SA
--- Would this type of algorithm give more practical clones?
