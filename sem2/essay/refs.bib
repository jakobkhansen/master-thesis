    abstract="Code Clone is a code snippet that has the same or similar code snippet in the same or different software system. The existence of code clones is an issue on software maintenance and a clue to understanding the structure and evolution of software systems. A large number of researches on code clones have been performed, and many tools for code clone analysis have been developed. In this chapter, we will explain some of the terms that are important for understanding code clones, such as definition, type, analysis granularity, and analysis domain. We will also outline the approaches and applications of code clone analysis.",
