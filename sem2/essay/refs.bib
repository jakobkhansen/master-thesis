    abstract="Code Clone is a code snippet that has the same or similar code snippet in the same or different software system. The existence of code clones is an issue on software maintenance and a clue to understanding the structure and evolution of software systems. A large number of researches on code clones have been performed, and many tools for code clone analysis have been developed. In this chapter, we will explain some of the terms that are important for understanding code clones, such as definition, type, analysis granularity, and analysis domain. We will also outline the approaches and applications of code clone analysis.",

    abstract = {Code clone is a well-known code smell that needs to be detected and managed during the software development process. However, the existing clone detectors have one or more of the three shortcomings: (a) limitation in detecting Type-3 clones, (b) they come as stand-alone tools separate from IDE and thus cannot support clone-aware development, (c) they overwhelm the developer with all clones from the entire code-base, instead of a focused search for clones of a selected code segment of the developer's interest.This paper presents our IDE-integrated clone search tool, that addresses all the above issues. For clone detection, we adapt a suffix-tree-based hybrid algorithm. Through an asymptotic analysis, we show that our approach for clone detection is both time and memory efficient. Moreover, using three separate empirical studies, we demonstrate that our tool is flexibly usable for searching exact (Type-1) and near-miss (Type-2 and Type-3) clones with high precision and recall.},

abstract = {Software code cloning is inevitable during software development and unmanaged cloning practice can create substantial problems for software maintenance and evolution. Current research in the area software clones includes, but is not limited to: finding ways to manage clones; gaining more control over clone generation; and, studying clone evolution and its effects on the evolution of software. In this study, we investigate tools and techniques for detecting, managing, and understanding the evolution of clones, as well as design a convenient tool to make those techniques available to a developer's software development environment. Towards the goal of promoting the practical use of code clone research and to provide better support for managing clones in software systems, we first developed SimEclipse: a clone-aware software development platform, and then, using the tool, we performed a study to investigate the usefulness of using a number clone based technologies in an integrated platform rather than using those discretely. Finally, a small scale user study is performed to evaluate SimEclipse's effectiveness, usability and information management with respect to some pre-defined clone management activities. We believe that both researchers and developers would enjoy and utilize the benefits of using SimEclipse for different aspects of code clone research as well as for managing cloned code in software systems.},
