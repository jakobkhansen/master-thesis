* The purpose of my thesis
  The purpose of my thesis is to create a tool which supports management of code clones in
  a modern IDE environment in order to research code clone analysis and IDE tooling. This
  involves creating/implementing algorithms for detection and merging of code clones and
  evaluating LSP as a tool for modern IDE tooling. For algorithms its interesting to
  consider the aspect of incremental algorithms, since we are doing small edits to large
  codebases, we don't want to recompute everything we have computed
